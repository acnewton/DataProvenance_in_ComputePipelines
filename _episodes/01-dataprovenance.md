teaching: 5
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What do you have to consider with data provenance in compute pipelines?"

## Data provenance shows the history of data

## All steps need to be taken into account in a compute pipeline

## Metadata is essential in recording data provenance

## iRODS Python API can be used in compute pipelines
